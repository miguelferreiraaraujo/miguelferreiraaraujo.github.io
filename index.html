					<br>
                    <p>   
                     Welcome to Miguel's webpage. Miguel is a PhD candidate in Earthquake Engineering at the University of Porto (Portugal).
                     Over the past few years, Miguel has conducted academic work in the field of earthquake engineering and is the author of
                     several publications in peer-reviewed international journals and conferences. During his academic experience, Miguel was awarded a research grant from the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology.
                     He has benefited from the interaction with collegues from various institutions, particularly during his
                     post-graduate studies at the UME Graduate School (Italy), summer course at the Bahaus-Universität Weimar (Germany) and mobile programme at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil). Miguel is currently carrying out research work in collaboration with
                     Professor Ahmed Elgazhouli at the Imperial College London (UK).
                     <br><br>
                     Previously, as a structural engineer at DHV, SA. (Portugal), now Royal Haskoning DHV, Miguel was involved in the structural and geotechnical design of several water supply systems and wastewater treatment plants located in Portugal.
                     While a Civil Engineering graduate, Miguel initiated his professional experience as part-time pratictioner at a local design office in Porto (Portugal) and integrated a non-profit students' firm (JUNIFEUP) at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto.
                     Miguel's appetite for new challenges drove him to create, along with three PhD fellow colleagues, ACAdivulge and develop a RFID technology-based system that promotes real-time facebook “likes” anywhere.

              Understanding risk to natural perils requires profound knowledge of every single component that defines it: hazard, exposure and vulnerability.
              Accurate estimates of assets at risk (exposure) and representations of physical, societal and economic loss ratios for increasing intensities
              of the peril (vulnerability) are key to foster the best predictions of risk.
              Miguel has a track-record experience in exposure and vulnerability model development.
              He recently produced several residential exposure and vulnerability models to seismic-prone regions
              and created a novel industrial seismic risk model for Portugal that incorporates property and industry-specific business interruption losses.

                    Urban Rehabilitation or Disaster Risk Reduction are topics on top of the agenda of many
                    public authorities and stakeholders. The assessment and strengthening of existing buildings located in seismic-prone regions is
                    a challenge that many structural practitioners have to face. Under his PhD dissertation, Miguel dedicated particular attention to
                    the revision of part 3 of Eurocode 8, which is the European code that specifically address this issue. He has also devoted work to
                    the strengthening of existing building using traditional and innovative steel systems. Coupled with his risk assessment background,
                    Miguel offers more oriented life-cycle cost-benefit strengthening solutions.

                    <p class="text-muted">
                    Modelling reality and predicting the effects of future events is a rather challenging task, wherein
                    numerous issues related with bias-variance trade-offs, physical representation of most critical phenomena
                    and model validation play a critical role. Miguel has experience in handeling these various issues. One of Miguel's main
                    research lines concerns the advanced numerical modelling of steel elements, particularly when subjected to extreme loads (e.g., earthquakes). Monitoring fracture initiation
                    or simulating local buckling instability phenomena are aspects of extreme relevance when assessing the fragility of an existing structure, as well as
                    its life-cycle and sustainability.

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">
                                PRISE was a highly successful nationally funded research project carried out under the leadership of Dr. Mário Marques.
                                The project involved several academic and industry institutions and provided valuable output both for the CAT modelling
                                community and the Portuguese society in general.
                            </p>
                            <h5> The Project </h5>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://prise.fe.up.pt/prise_website/">PRISE</a>
                                was a three-year project founded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology under the leadership of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mario_Marques9">Dr. Mário Marques</a>.
                                The project aimed at filling the existing lack of an innovative methodology to estimate the financial and human losses correlated to structural damage in buildings,
                                 which includes the definition of Portuguese Hazard and built heritage exposure models; the characterization of the physical vulnerability of the
                                buildings; and the establishment of cost of repair/replacement estimates relationships. Given the number of specific tasks to be
                                carried out, the project featured the collaboration with 
                                <a href="http://www.lnec.pt/pt/">National Laboratory of Civil Engineering (LNEC)</a>
                                ,

                                The PRISE project provided several important outcomes to the scientific community and resulted in various publications. A major outcome of the project
                                was the development of a real-time risk assessment web-based platform in collaboration with the
                                <a href="http://www.prociv.pt/">Portuguese Civil Protection</a>, with enormous scope both for the industry and public authorities.

                            <h5> Industrial Model for Mainland Portugal </h5>
                            <p>
                            PRISE, and Miguel's PhD dissertation, constituted the first attempt within academia to develop an industrial seismic risk model for Portugal.
                            The three main components of risk (hazard, exposure, vulnerability) were thoroughly investigated within the project.
                            The models were afterwards implemented in the PRISE web-based risk assessment platform, which relies on the open-source <a href="http://www.globalquakemodel.org/openquake/about/">OpenQuake engine</a>
                            developed within the <a href="http://www.globalquakemodel.org/">Gobal Earthquake Model</a> initiative
                            and provides user-friendly and interactive cloud-based computing and data visualization. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The model includes information relative to every industrial activity of the 2-digit Portuguese Standard Industrial Classification (CAE) system. A brief description of the model developed is provided below: 
                                <ul class="list-project">
                                    <li>The developed industrial exposure model incorporates extensive statistical economic information collected from the Portuguese Institute of Statistics and a thorough representation of the Portuguese industrial
                                    building stock. To characterize the variability in geometric and material properties of the as-buit building stock, more than 200 blueprint drawings of industrial buildings designed in Portugal over the years were inspected.
                                    Probability distribution functions were fitted to the collected data and used to randomly generate hundreds of synthetic industrial buildings representative of reality. Each single sytentic building was subjected to
                                    earthquake loading by means of robust numerical analysis incorporating all sources of damage typically observed in post-reconnaissance campaigns. Novel categories of industrial buildings associated to similar levels of 
                                    loss (taxonomies) were proposed.</li>

                            <figure><center font size="1"> Some figures of the exposure and vulnerability models developed. </center></figure> 
                            </p>
                                    <li> The outputs of the numerical analysis of every single synthetic building were assessed and correlated to potential losses.
                                    Losses to property incorporating damage to structural and non-structural components and industry-specific contents (e.g., machinery and equipment)
                                    were included in the model. Business interruption losses were modelled acounting both for direct and indirect effects, including the impact of input factor,
                                    infrastructure and supply chain disruptions in each industry-specific production.</li>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <li> Georeferenced information on the distribution of the Portuguese industrial building stock was collected from existing databases
                                    (e.g., OpenStreet Maps, CORINE Land Cover inventory or AICEP Global Find platform) and incorporated in the exposure model. Every developed model
                                    was implemented in the PRISE web-based platform, which provides a distribution of georeferenced property and business interruption losses for Mainland Portugal.

                            <p>
                            The overall mean aggregated industrial toll for mainland Portugal was estimated to be around 3.8 billion €, which
                            represents 2.2% of the Portuguese GDP in 2014. The Portuguese industrial sector roughly contributes to 21% of the
                            national GDP. A potential 10% reduction in the country’s industrial annual revenue would be expected for an earthquake event with
                            a return period of 475 years. Over 15000 mean aggregated full time employment jobs were estimated to be lost.

                                The part of the European Code (EC8-3) that specifically addresses the seismic assessment and strengthening of existing buildings is still at an early stage of development and exhibits
                                several inconsistencies and needs of further research. A recent nationally funded research project held at the University of Porto under the leadership of Prof. Raimundo Delgado
                                aimed at revising the current version of EC8-3 and providing new methodologies to be implemented in the next generation of the code.

                            <h5> Is the code trustworthy?</h5>
                            <p>
                                The revision of EC8-3 in the context of the <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/projectos_geral.mostra_projecto?p_id=64318">PTDC/ECM/108098/2008</a> project was carried out in parallel to 
                                reinforced concrete and steel structures. Miguel contributed to this project in the revision of the code's current methodologies for the seismic safety assessment of existing steel structures. The work was conducted under supervision of
                                <a href="https://paginas.fe.up.pt/~jmcastro/">Dr. José Miguel Castro</a>. In general lines, the work was developed in two phases: (i) a first one that consisted on a practical application of EC8-3
                                and comparison with other state-of-the-art methodologies with the aim of identifying the code main limitations; (ii) and a second one that was devoted to the proposal of new methodologies. 
                            <p>
                                EC8-3 is the only European code that focuses on the assessment of existing buildings. Nevertheless, despite its key role in today's needs for rehabilitation of the built heritage, EC8-3 was found to exhibit
                                several inconsistencies. Some limitations are briefly presented below:
                                <ul class="list-project">
                                    <li>The code lacks on conceptual consistency when asking the analyst to verify the safety of existing steel buildings by requiring information that cannot be obtained from
                                    commonly adopted linear procedures.                                   
                                    <!--According to EC8-3, safety verifications shall always be
                                    conducted in terms of plastic rotations regardless the type of procedures adopted. However, since plastic rotations cannot be obtained from linear analyses, which are commonly
                                    adopted by most practitioners, the analyst will be naturally faced with such ambiguous situation and get stuck during the assessment process.-->
                                    </li>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <li>
                                    <!--To account for the variability in the ground motion produced by a future earthquake event, EC8-3 preconizes the use of a set of real, synthetic or artificial ground motions selected and scaled according to specific criteria.
                                    The code's ground motion selection and scaling procedure was found to be consistent (i.e., to provide unbiased mean building responses), but failed to be efficient and sufficient (i.e., introduces high variability
                                    in building responses).--> The code's ground motion selection and scaling procedure was found to be associated to an unacceptable and unknown probability of leading to mean building responses lower than the "true" ones.
                                    </li>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <li>
                                    The resemblance between the capacity limits proposed by EC8-3 for steel members and those provided in the American standard (ASCE41-13) suggests a direct reproduction of the American limits by Eurocode, despite the fact that American profiles are known to be significantly
                                    different from those adopted in Europe. <!--It was found that the limits proposed by EC8-3 for deep wide-flange European IPE profiles are systematically non-conservative (i.e., higher than the capacity exhibited by real members), which level of error increases with the increase in the axial
                                    load level. Hence, the current capacity limits proposed by EC8-3 for steel members should be revised, as they have a direct impact in the safety assessment of an existing building.-->

                            Miguel's research work aimed not only at pointing out to current code limitations and research needs, but also, and importantly, at contributing with new methodologies for the revision of EC8-3 in a future generation of Eurocodes.

                            The advanced analysis and modelling of the behaviour of steel structures is one of Miguel's main research interests. Miguel's work has been focused on
                            exploratory research on the capacity of steel elements and proposal of novel numerical modelling approaches. Miguel has also focused on the use of
                            steel elements as a strengthening solution to existing reinforced concrete (RC) buildings.

                            <p>
                            The strengthening and rehabilitation of existing buildings using steel elements is a topic of most interest to Miguel. Miguel promoted further discussion on this topic by organizing a workshop on Urban Rehabilitation at the University of Porto within the <a href="https://paginas.fe.up.pt/~dce/doku.php">1st Doctoral Congress on Engineering</a>.
                            The workshop involved both the scientific community and the construction industry, having the participation of the <a href="https://paginas.fe.up.pt/~icfeup/">Construction Institute</a> of the University of Porto, the <a href="http://www.pablopita.com/">Pablo Pita</a> architecture partnership, the engineering consultants <a href="http://www.ncrep.pt/">NCREP</a>, 
                            the construction company <a href="http://www.casais.pt/">Casais</a> and <a href="http://www.portovivosru.pt/">Porto Vivo</a>, which is a company of public capital that aims at promoting urban rehabilitation in the city of Porto.
                            <p></p>
                            <p> Miguel also participated together with Dr. Castro in an international seminar on strengthening and rehabilitation held at the University of Porto in cooperation with <a href="https://www.hilti.pt/SIRR13">Hilti</a>. The work presented addressed the strengthening of existing steel buildings from a Part 3 of Eurocode 8 perspective. Issues related with the in-situ inspection
                            of the condition of steel members and local strengthening interventions were discussed. Recently, Miguel wrote a book chapter, alongside with Dr. Castro, <a href="https://www.docenti.unina.it/MARIO.D'ANIELLO">Dr. Mario D'Aniello</a> and <a href="https://www.docenti.unina.it/raffaele.landolfo">Dr. Raffaele Landolfo</a>, on the use of traditional and innovative steel solutions in the strengthening

                            Miguel's experience in dealing with the assessment of existing bridges initated with his MSc dissertation, which focused on the impact of the rheological effects of concrete on the long-term behaviour of steel-concrete composite bridges.
                            Later, Miguel joined a nationally funded research project held at the University of Porto under the leadership of Prof. Raimundo Delgado that was dedicated to the seismic safety assessment and retrofitting of bridges.

                            <h5> Seismic Assessment of existing bridges to Part 2 of Eurocode 8 </h5>
                            <p>
                                Miguel integrated in 2010 the <a href="http://www.fct.pt/apoios/projectos/consulta/vglobal_projecto.phtml.en?idProjecto=72596&idElemConcurso=3972">PTDC/ECM/72596/2006</a> research project. The project was carried out at the University of Porto under the leadership of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raimundo_Delgado">Prof. Raimundo Delgado</a>
                                and specifically addressed the seismic safety assessment and strengthening of bridges. Miguel's involvement in the project had as main objective the assessment of the seismic safety of a set of existing bridges located in the northern region of Portugal, which had been designed according to the former national legislation. The various analysis procedures proposed in the
                                part 2 of Eurocode 8 were assessed and compared to those preconized in the former national code. The work was developed under greatly appreciated guidance provided by <a href="http://www.eucentre.it/?attachment_id=1228">Dr. Ricardo Monteiro</a>.
                            </p>
                                <p></p>
                            <p>
                                The scope of the research work developed allowed providing a simplistic, but interesting, comparison between the design seismic level preconized in the recent version of Eurocode 8 and that defined in the former Portuguese legislation (RSA). Such simplified comparison may have extreme relevance in identifying structures that have been designed following the seismic provisions preconized by the former Portuguese code and could be unsafe
                                according to Eurocode 8. 
                            </p>

                                Moreover, a study focused on the seismic behaviour of irregular-in-plan (e.g., curved) bridges was equally carried out within the project, and a novel multidirectional pushover analysis metholodogy was proposed. 
                            </p>                
                            <h5> Long-term behaviour of steel-concrete composite bridges </h5>
                            <p>
                                Under supervision of <a href="http://www.adfconsultores.com/equipa.asp?id=0&mi=2">Prof. Adão da Fonseca</a>, Miguel's MSc dissertation was dedicated to the assessment of the impact of rheological effects of concrete in the behaviour of steel-concrete composite bridges.                                
                                The work developed had the beautiful Pedro and Inês bridge as case study example, which is located in the city of Coimbra and was named in memory of one of the city's and Portuguese history most iconic legends of a forbidden love afair between the prince D. Pedro I and Inês de Castro, his wife's chaperone.
                                The rheological effects of concrete were defined based on Eurocode 2 and ACI209R-92 and modelled using both simplified algebraic methods and more robust time-dependent numerical methods. A thorough parametric study that aimed at assessing the impact of various environmental effects was also provided.

                                and Araújo, was an initiative that came to life during an art gallery visit made by the three colleagues and friends during their enrollment in the <a href="https://www.uni-weimar.de/summerschool/en/courses/archive/model-validation-and-simulation-13"> Bahaus-Universität Weimar summer course </a>, wherein they felt the need to share the beauty of the exposed art pieces. Instantly, they enthusiastically came across
                                the ideia of promoting real-time commenting and sharing of those art pieces with friends on facebook. Joining forces with <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/FUNC_GERAL.FORMVIEW?p_codigo=480679"> Tiago </a>, a highly motivated software engineering professor and researcher at the University of Porto, the ACAdivulge team was set up.

Various hardware solutions were investigated, which had to optimize the problem of being wireless, having long-life with high battery storage capacity and, naturally, being capable of fulfilling the main intention of promoting real-time facebook likes and shares.
                                A RFID-based prototype incorporating an XBee interface to input/output data was developed alongside with a Windows environment user-friendly managing software. The developed TAG-Tech system has the following features:
